# hey, I'm erg0nix
<small class="subtitle">ergo (therefore) + nix (nothing/unix) = therefore nothing/linux</small>

backend developer based in oslo, norway.

I play tennis and throw javelin. love indie games and occasionally triple a games. into retro tech. wish I was better at embedded programming and hardware, not just software.

at work I do kotlin with ktor. at home I write golang and python, dabbling in rust for cli tools. 

I use arch on my desktop, mac laptop at work. most of my side projects are private on github, but check out the public ones.
