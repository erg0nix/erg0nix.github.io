Finally got around to setup a personal site. Don't yet know what to do with it. But I like the idea of people having personal websites instead of social media for contact.

## why a personal website?

I haven't posted anything on social media in 7 years, but I'm excited to maybe post something here.

Doesn't have to be perfect or polished. This site is pretty basic and that's fine. it's a place to put stuff and write about code or tools I find useful.

I found that its quite fun to be able to display my own content in any way I would like.


## what I might share

Bookmarks, posts, images, projects, or even recipes. Its also a fun place to inject any cool css or js that I might find and want to test out that wouldn't be something I would use in anything professional, but find cool.

I have this idea of a "public feed", subscribing to rss feeds that I would like to follow, but keeping it open. Allowing others to see what my feed is and what I read and follow. How will I set this up? I don't know yet. Im thinking of something like a daily pull to get the content and generating the feed and just deploying everytime I want it updated. Make links great again sort of.

## setup

Currently Im just hosting this on Github with Hugo, and using some actions to publish. Using a custom theme, a lot vibed since I don't enjoy frontend that much, even though I have some strong opionions about the look and feel, but don't like fiddling around with it too much.
