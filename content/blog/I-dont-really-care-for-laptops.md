title = 'I Dont Really Care for Laptops'
+++

I don't really care for laptops. Hot take. I have nothing more against them tho other than that I have to 
carry them around. But I feel like there should be something better. And what don't I mind carrying around? My phone.
Its always just there in my pocket.

I don't generally use my laptop any other place than at different workstations. Never using them at a cozy cafe, on the
train or other transports, in bed or the couch. The laptops are always used at different workstations, plugged into
different cables for peripherals like monitors, keyboards and mouse, or whatever like charging. Mostly only plugged into
the monitor though with usb-c with charging. So for me the laptop is just a bigger thing I have to carry around.

I get it, laptops are nice because it has a screen and a keyboard and whatever, and you can use them on the fly. So
does phones, and all I need to do is keep it in my pocket. 

## So what do I want then?

I want my phone to be my "laptop". I want my phone to be the computer I use. And when I say this I don't imagine like
using iOS or android, but more something like a full on linux phone. But I also want power and speed, enough to use as 
a developer, and today that needs at least 32 gigs of ram. So yes, I wouldn't mind a chunky phone.

Look at this beauty:

This is the [Mecha Comet](https://mecha.so/comet). A beauty. Sure the insides aren't what I hope for in terms of hardware. I think it's a raspberry pi?
Yeah, well. I can attach a keyboard (blackberry style), or a gamepad, or a trackpad or whatever to it. And I think
they have made their own sort of OS with debian or something.

I want something like this. A phone just with linux, that can change between modes. Phone mode when not connected to a
monitor, and workstation mode when connected to the monitor or workstation. And I wouldn't mind it being a brick, as long as it has the
power I need. I wouldn't mind connecting it to external stuff like an eGPU for example, for more power. Thats basically
how I use my laptop today.

## What can I do?

I don't know. I could just create my own. Use a well enough SBC (Single Board Computer) and hook up what I need. 
Install possibly the [Ubuntu Touch](https://www.ubuntu-touch.io/) OS on it and happy days. 

I tried looking. Its difficult finding the hardware. I wonder how people find and put together the hardware. Seems like
its difficult.

So this is what I would want instead of a laptop.
